### What I Learned

This project helped me practice using CSS Grid for responsive layouts. I also learned how to use SCSS variables and mixins to create reusable styles. Here's an example of a mixin I used:

```scss
@mixin text-preset-1 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
